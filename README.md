# My REST API
This project is a part of "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp" by The London App Brewery, instructed by Dr. Angela Yu and hosted through Udemy. In this project I have created my own REST API to access to a collection of articles from a locally hosted database.

- I have used all the HTTP Request Verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE)
- I have implemented the specific patterns of routes/ endpoint URLs in accordance with the standard guidelines of RESTful Routing.
